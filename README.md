# Variational-phase-field-method-for-dynamic-fracture-problem

A research outcome from the author as a postdoc at Johns Hopkins, working on the dynamic fracture of brittle materials.

This code conducts phase-field simulations of dynamic fracture problems in 2D and is parallelized with OpenMP and MPI.
